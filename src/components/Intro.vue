    <p>The issue list is reserved exclusively for bug reports
      and feature requests. If you open an issue that does not conform to the
      requirements, <strong>it will be closed immediately</strong>.
      <a href="#" @click="show = true">Why are we so strict about this?</a></p>
    <p>For simple questions, please use the following resources:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>Also, try to search for your issue â€“ it may have already been answered or
      even fixed in the development branch. However, if you find that an old,
      closed issue still persists in the latest version, you should open a new
      issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.</p>

          Maintaining open source projects, especially popular ones, is
          <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/" target="_blank">hard work</a>. As Vue's user base has grown, we are getting more and more usage questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests every single day.</p>
          <p>As a free and open source project, Vue also has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to ensure the project's sustainability is to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Prioritize more concrete work (bug fixes and new features);</li>
            <li>Improve issue triaging efficiency.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            For (1), we have decided to use the GitHub issue lists exclusively for work that has well-defined, actionable goals. Questions and open ended discussions should be posted to mediums that are better suited for them.
          </p>
          <p>For (2), we have found that issues that do not provide proper information upfront usually results in terribly inefficient back-and-forth communication just to extract the basic information needed for actual triaging. This is exactly why we have created this app: to ensure that every issue is created with the necessary information, and to save time on both sides.</p>
