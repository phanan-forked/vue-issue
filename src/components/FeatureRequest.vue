          Explain your use case, context, and rationale behind this feature request.
          An important design goal of Vue is keeping the API surface small and
          straighforward. In general, we only consider adding new features that
          solve a problem that cannot be easily dealt with using existing APIs
          (i.e. not just an alternative way of doing things that can already be
          done). The problem should also be common enough to justify the addition.
